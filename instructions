Instructions for Using C++ Program: Stack, Queue, and Selection Sort Operations
Overview:
This C++ program demonstrates the implementation of stack operations, queue operations, and the selection sort algorithm. It provides a menu-driven interface to interact with stacks, queues, and sort arrays of integers.

Usage:
Main Menu:

When you run the program, you will be presented with the Main Menu:

Main Menu
1. Stack Operations
2. Queue Operations
3. Sort a List
4. Exit
Enter the number corresponding to the operation you want to perform and press Enter.
Stack Operations:

Choose option 1 from the main menu to perform stack operations.
Available operations include:
1. Push(): Push an item onto the stack.
2. Pop(): Pop an item from the stack.
3. isEmpty(): Check if the stack is empty.
4. isFull(): Check if the stack is full.
5. peek(): View the item at a specific position in the stack.
6. count(): Count the number of items in the stack.
7. change(): Change the value of an item at a specific position in the stack.
8. display(): Display all items in the stack.
9. Clear Screen: Clear the console screen (works on Windows, may need adjustment for other platforms).
Queue Operations:

Choose option 2 from the main menu to perform queue operations.
Available operations include:
1. Enqueue(): Add an item to the queue.
2. Dequeue(): Remove an item from the queue.
3. isEmpty(): Check if the queue is empty.
4. isFull(): Check if the queue is full.
5. count(): Count the number of items in the queue.
6. display(): Display all items in the queue.
7. Clear Screen: Clear the console screen (works on Windows, may need adjustment for other platforms).
Sort a List:

Choose option 3 from the main menu to sort an array of integers using the selection sort algorithm.
Follow the prompts to enter the number of elements in the array and the elements themselves.
The sorted array will be displayed after sorting.
Exiting the Program:

Choose option 4 from the main menu to exit the program.
Notes:
Ensure valid inputs are provided as per the program's prompts to avoid unexpected behavior.
The program handles stack overflow, underflow, queue overflow, and underflow conditions.
Use the Clear Screen option (9) to maintain a clean console interface, especially useful for repetitive operations.
